# Group Exercise - Contrasting architectures 


## Instructions for Students:

1. Form teams of 3-5 members.
2. Each team will receive diagrams of two different architectural approaches: a monolithic architecture and a serverless cloud architecture.
3. Take 15-20 minutes to review the diagrams with your team and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each architecture.
4. Consider aspects such as scalability, maintainability, deployment complexity, cost, performance, and developer productivity during your discussion.
5. After the discussion, each team will present their observations to the class.
6. Share your team's insights regarding the benefits and drawbacks of each architecture.
7. Listen to other teams' presentations and take note of additional points that may not have been discussed in your group.
8. Participate in the class discussion following each team's presentation to clarify points and contribute further insights.
9. Reflect on the key differences and considerations between the two architectures as summarized by the instructor.
10. Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the choice of architecture should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of each project.
